# Count
Chapter 2, exercise 2

Simple extension of the previous exercise. I almost forgot to strip the newline from the input, but I did remember I had to declare the `size` variable.  Also, I keep forgetting to add an explicit newline to the output.

This solution does satisfy the exercise constraints.
