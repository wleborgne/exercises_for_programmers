# Hello

Slightly complicated greeting program from Chapter 2, exercise 1.
This version satisfies the constraint of keeping input, string concatenation and output separate, as well as the first challenge of not using any variables (`|>` for the win!).

Compile and run via

`mix run -e Hello.hello`

or

```
$ iex -S mix
iex(1)> Hello.hello
```
